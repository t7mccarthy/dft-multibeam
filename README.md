# dft-multibeam
### Using the Fast Fourier transform to focus radiation beams on multiple targets.

All the up-to-date stuff is in **3D_FFT_multibeam_opt.py**. Change the number of antennas, the spacing, the wave number, and the targets to your liking. The program will work its magic and give you a great, optimized solution for creating multibeam patters with your uniformly spaced planar array of any size.
